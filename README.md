# Updates and dev notes (For whoever is interested)

As this is a website I'm making just for fun on my free time, it will be updated when I get the time.

## Main Reason for making this site

Drawing has been a big part of my life ever since I could hold a pencil.
Over the years I have a lot of drawings with some sort of background stories, so the main goal here is to gather everything in one place and let people see and read whatever I come up with.

## Regarding updates and building this site

As this is a silly little side project of mine, it will not have any regular updates. At the time of writing this I am currently taking a front end course where I'm soon about to start as an intern as a front end developer, and therefore I am uncertain how much work I will get done.

## Plans for this site

-This site will originally be in my native language, which is Norwegian, but I will eventually add the possibility of a translator so you can read it in English.

-Might try to turn this into an app for mobile in the future, but for now I will make it as responsive as I can so the site can function properly on both computers and mobiles.
